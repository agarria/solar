                  <p>Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on
                     your behalf, may make a verifiable CA User request related to your personal information.
                  </p>
                  <p>You may only make a verifiable CA User request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month
                     period. The verifiable CA User request must:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are: (1) the person
                        about whom we collected personal information; or (2) an authorized representative.
                     </li>
                     <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate,
                        and respond to it.
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your
                     identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the personal information relates to you.
                     Making a verifiable CA User request does not require that you create an account with us. We will
                     only use personal information provided in a verifiable CA User request to verify the requestor's
                     identity or authority to make the request.

                  <i>Response Timing and Format</i>
                  <p>We endeavor to respond to all verifiable CA User requests within forty-five (45) days of the receipt
                     thereof. If we require more time (up to ninety (90) days), we will inform you of the reason and
                     extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your
                     option. Any disclosures that we provide will only cover the twelve (12) month period preceding the
                     receipt of your verifiable request. The response that we provide will also explain the reasons that
                     we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a
                     format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit
                     the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
                  </p>
                  <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable CA User request unless it is
                     excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we
                     will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your
                     request.
